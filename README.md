# XC888 Code

These folders contain all code I have written for the XC888. It is divided in three subfolders. A piece of code starts within the _Testings_ folder. When that works I try to make it work in _bigger Things_ (bigger code with other parts). And the last stage is the _For Real_ folder. In this folder, only the code that is in the final product will be used.
