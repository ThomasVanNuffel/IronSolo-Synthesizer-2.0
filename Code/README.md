# IronSolo Synthesizer 2.0
For my second year Embedded Hardware we needed to make a complete product starting from scratch. The goal of my project is to make a synthesizer. I have some experience with it because I make music in my free time and previous year (as a first years student) I also tried to make a synthesizer (but just the basics). This year I will extend this to a next level with more features and compatibility.
